<p:introduction>
<div>

<p>
Last revised 16:00 ET January 15, 2010.
</p>
<p><i>Please send comments about this plan to the</i> <a href="mailto:e4-dev@eclipse.org">e4-dev@eclipse.org</a> <i>developer
  mailing list.</i>
</p>
<p>This document lays out the feature and API set for the first feature release
  of the Eclipse e4 project, designated release 1.0.
</p>

<p>Plans do not materialize out of nowhere, nor are they entirely static. To
  ensure the planning process is transparent and open to the entire Eclipse community,
  we (the e4 team) post plans in an embryonic form and revise them
  throughout the release cycle. </p>
<p>The first part of the plan deals with the important matters of release deliverables,
  release milestones, target operating environments, and release-to-release compatibility.
  These are all things that need to be clear for any release, even if no features
  were to change. </p>
<p>The remainder of the plan consists of plan items for all of the component areas
  under the e4 Project. Each plan item covers a feature or API
  that is to be added to the e4 Project deliverables, or some aspect of
  the e4 Project that is to be improved. Each plan item has its own entry
  in the Eclipse bugzilla database, with a title and a concise summary (usually
  a single paragraph) that explains the work item at a suitably high enough level
  so that everyone can readily understand what the work item is without having
  to understand the nitty-gritty detail. </p>
<p>Not all plan items represent the same amount of work; some may be quite large,
  others, quite small. Some plan items may involve work that is localized to
  a single component; others may involve coordinated changes to several components;
  other may pervade the entire project. Although some plan items are for work that
  is more pressing than others, the plan items appear in no particular order. </p>
<p>Fixing bugs, improving test coverage, documentation,
  examples, performance tuning, usability, etc. are considered routine ongoing
  maintenance activities and are not included in this plan unless they would
  also involve a significant change to the API or feature set, or involve a significant
  amount of work. The intent of the plan is to account for all interesting feature work. </p>
<p>The current status of each plan item is noted: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Committed</b> plan item - A committed plan item is one that we have
    decided to address for the release.</li>
  <li><b>Proposed</b> plan item - A proposed plan item is one that we are considering
    addressing for the release. Although we are actively investigating it, we
    are not yet in a position to commit to it, or to say that we won't be able
    to address it. After due consideration, a proposal will either be committed
    or deferred.</li>
  <li><b>Deferred</b> plan item - A reasonable proposal that will not make it
    in to this release for some reason is marked as deferred with a brief note
    as to why it was deferred. Deferred plan items may resurface as committed
    plan items at a later point.</li>
</ul>

<!-- ============================================== -->

<p:target_environments>

<div>
<p>In order to remain current, each e4 Project release targets reasonably current
  operating environments.</p>
<p>Most of the e4 Project is &quot;pure&quot; Java code and has no direct dependence
  on the underlying operating system. The chief dependence is therefore on the
  Java Platform itself. Portions are targeted to specific classes of operating
  environments, requiring their source code to only reference facilities available
  in particular class libraries (e.g. J2ME Foundation 1.0, J2SE 1.3 and 1.4,
  etc.). In general, the 1.0 release of the Eclipse Project is developed on Java SE 5.</p>
<p>e4 has dependencies on components from other Eclipse projects, notably the Platform
project, and the EMF project. While specific version dependencies may specify
a wider range, e4 is generally built and tested against the versions contained in the 
Helios release train.</p>
<p>There are many different implementations of the Java Platform running atop
  a variety of operating systems. We focus our testing on a handful of
  popular combinations of operating system and Java Platform; these are our <em>reference
  platforms</em>. Eclipse undoubtedly runs fine in many operating environments
  beyond the reference platforms we test. However, since we do not systematically test
  them we cannot vouch for them. Problems encountered when running Eclipse on a
  non-reference platform that cannot be recreated on any reference platform will
  be given lower priority than problems with running Eclipse on a reference platform.</p>
<p>e4 also has dependencies on browser technologies such as Javascript. The
reference platforms listed below show the versions of these technologies that we
are developing and testing against.</p>
<p>e4 1.0 is tested and validated on the following reference platforms
  (this list is updated over the course of the release cycle):</p>

 </center>
<p>As stated above, <i>we expect that e4 works fine on other current
  Java VM and OS versions but we cannot flag these as reference platforms without
  significant community support for testing them.</i></p>
</div>

<p:internationalization>
<p>The e4 platform is designed as the basis for internationalized products. The
  user interface elements provided by the e4 components, including dialogs
  and error messages, are externalized. The English strings are provided as the
  default resource bundles.</p>
<p>Latin-1 and DBCS locales are supported by e4 on all reference platforms;
  BIDI locales are supported by e4 everywhere but on Motif.</p>
<p>e4 supports GB 18030 (level 1), the Chinese code page standard,
  on Windows XP and 2000, Linux/GTK and the Macintosh.</p>
<p>German and Japanese locales are tested.</p>
</p:internationalization>

<!-- ============================================== -->

<p:compatibility_with_previous_releases>
<div>

<h3>Compatibility of e4 1.0 with previous Eclipse project releases</h3>
<p>Portions of e4 will be compatible with Eclipse 3.5 (and all earlier 3.x versions).
However, compatibility is not a primary focus for this initial release of e4, and there
is no firm promise of compatibility between e4 and earlier Eclipse releases of any kind.
Compatibility with Eclipse 3.x is anticipated to be a major focus of the subsequent e4 release.
</p>
  
<p><strong>Workspace Compatibility:</strong> e4 1.0 will be upwards
  workspace-compatible with ealier 3.x versions of the Eclipse SDK unless noted.
  This means that workspaces and projects created with Eclipse SDK 3.4 .. 3.0 can be successfully
  opened by e4 1.0 and upgraded to an e4 workspace. This includes both
  hidden metadata, which is localized to a particular workspace, as well as metadata
  files found within a workspace project (e.g., the .project file), which may
  propagate between workspaces via file copying or team repositories. Individual
  plug-ins developed for e4 1.0 should provide similar upwards compatibility
  for their hidden and visible workspace metadata created by earlier versions;
  1.0 plug-in developers are responsible for ensuring that their plug-ins recognize
  metadata from earlier versions and process it appropriately. User
  interface session state may be discarded when a workspace is upgraded. Downward
  workspace compatibility is not supported. A workspace created (or opened) by
  a product based on e4 1.0 will be unusable with a product based an earlier
  version of Eclipse. Visible metadata files created (or overwritten) by e4 1.0
  will generally be unusable with earlier versions of Eclipse. </p>
  
<p><strong>Non-compliant usage of API's</strong>: All non-API methods and classes,
  and certainly everything in a package with &quot;internal&quot; in its name,
  are considered implementation details which may vary between operating environment
  and are subject to change without notice. Client plug-ins that directly depend
  on anything other than what is specified in the Eclipse SDK API are inherently
  unsupportable and receive no guarantees about compatibility within a single
  release much less with earlier releases. Refer to
  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-API%20use/eclipse-api-usage-rules.html">
    <em>How to Use the Eclipse API</em>
  </a> for information about how to write compliant plug-ins. </p>

<p:themes_and_priorities>

<p:preamble>
<div>
<p>The plan items listed below were defined according to contributor requirements and the Eclipse
  <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/RequirementsCouncilThemesAndPriorities">Themes and Priorities</a>
  set forth by the Eclipse Requirements Council. Each plan item covers a feature or API that is
  to be added to the e4 Project deliverables, or some aspect of the e4 Project that is
  to be improved. Each plan item has its own entry in the Eclipse bugzilla database, with a title
  and a concise summary (usually a single paragraph) that explains the work item at a suitably
  high enough level so that everyone can readily understand what the work item.</p>
<p> Although there are several components under the e4 project, there
  is a significant amount of commonality and shared effort between them. In general,
  many plan items involve coordinated changes to multiple components, and thus
  attempting to separate the items into sections based on sub-project leads to
  artificial distinctions between them. As such, this plan covers the work of all components
  under the e4 Project.</p>
<p>Not all plan items represent the same amount of work; some may be quite
  large, others, quite small. Although some plan items are for work that is 
  more pressing than others, the plan items appear in no particular order.
  See the corresponding bugzilla items for up-to-date status information on
  ongoing work and planned delivery milestones.</p>
<p>The current status of each plan item is noted:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Committed</b> plan item - A committed plan item is one that we have
    decided to address for the release. In bugzilla, this is reflected by
    having a concrete target milestone assigned.</li>
  <li><b>Proposed</b> plan item - A proposed plan item is one that we are
    considering addressing for the release. Although we are actively
    investigating it, we are not yet in a position to commit to it, or to say
    that we won't be able to address it. After due consideration, a proposal
    will either be committed or deferred. In bugzilla, such items are reflected
    by having a target milestone "1.0" or "---" assigned.</li>
  <li><b>Deferred</b> plan item - A reasonable proposal that will not make it in
    to this release for some reason is marked as deferred with a brief note as
    to why it was deferred. Deferred plan items may resurface as committed plan
    items at a later point. In bugzilla, such items are reflected by having
    a target milestone "Future" assigned.</li>

<p:description>
<p>Over the years the Eclipse platform has accumulated a large body of API,
resulting in a platform that is very powerful, but also very difficult for non-experts
to extend. This theme encompasses work to make the Eclipse platform much
easier to build applications and extensions upon.

<li>
<strong>Support declarative definition of user-interfaces.</strong> 
  We will work with the community to identify and provide access to a best-of-breed
  declarative mechanism for defining widget-based user-interfaces in Eclipse. [Platform UI, SWT]
(<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=252648">252648</a>)</li>

<li>
<strong>Model-based workbench.</strong>
  The functionality of the Eclipse Workbench and IDE have grown significantly
  since they were created. In some cases, older capabilities have been superceded
  by newer ones or have been proven to be unwieldy or otherwise unsatisfying.
  We will create a new model of the underlying structure of the Eclipse UI, which
  will make development simpler, but more flexible and dynamic. [Platform UI]
 (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id= 252650"> 252650</a>) </li>

<li>
<strong>Skinnable UI.</strong>
  We will enable developers to have greater control over the Eclipse UI, 
  making it simple to customize the appearance of Eclipse-based applications
  using industry standard mechanisms such as CSS. [Platform UI, SWT]
 (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id= 252653"> 252653</a>) </li>

<li>
<strong>Investigate scripting languages for Eclipse programmability.</strong> 
  We will investigate the use of scripting languages such as JavaScript, Ruby, etc., 
  in Eclipse development. Since this capability will require function from the
  model-based workbench, as well as support from the Equinox project, and 
  will potentially impact many other areas, only the initial investigation
  is planned during the R3.5 cycle. [All]
(<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=252654">252654</a>)</li>

<li>
<strong>Compatibility layer.</strong>
  Although the 1.0 release will not itself be backward compatible with earlier versions
  of the Eclipse platform, we will develop a compatibility layer that will allow
  plug-ins built against earlier versions of the platform to run without modification
  in e4. [All]

<p:theme name="Rich Internet Applications">
<p:description>
<p>Eclipse is well-established as the cross-platform IDE of choice, but it has become
  much more than that. The extensive and diverse range of applications that are being
  built on the Eclipse code base, and the constantly changing capabilities of the
  underlying systems on which it runs, are driving us to push the limits of our
  technology in almost every dimension. In particular, there is increasing demand for an equivalent
  of the Eclipse platform in the Rich Internet Application (RIA) space. Having a single
  platform that can be used to build and run applications on a wide variety of web and desktop 
  technologies, would enable application writers to exploit a wide range of 
  deployment options from a common code base.</p>
