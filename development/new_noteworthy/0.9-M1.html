<p>The first milestone from the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/e4/">e4 project</a> is here.
Take a peek at what the e4 team is up to, kick the tires on the demo applications
and check out the code. We are always looking for new contributors, so if you
see something that inspires you, get involved! Here are some of the more 
noteworthy things available in milestone build M1  (February 9, 2009) which is 
now available for <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/e4/downloads/" target="_top">download</a>.

    image metadata, and a view that shows Google Maps if the currently selected

        The runtime configuration of the UI elements is described by an EMF model,
        from which SWT widgets are generated. By making the application model explicit,
        the programming model becomes clearer for developers.  This will make it easier
        to both extend an existing system and compose RCP style applications.  It also
        drives better architecture in the way parts are defined and assembled, with the
        future goal of more flexible composition of workbenches to address non-IDE
        requirements.

    Application.ecore, contains types that are useful for any desktop UI
    application. Eclipse-specific extensions to that model, such as perspectives
    and views that are shared across perspectives, are in a separate schema,
    Workbench.ecore. Other applications or platforms may use the same technique
    for extending the schema as needed, and at the same time, we keep the
    complexity of the base schema at a minimum.

    <td width="70%" valign="top"> 
	SWT widgets can now be styled via CSS stylesheets. This work originated in the 
	<a href="http://tk-ui.sourceforge.net/user-guide/cssengine.html ">TK-UI project</a> 
	and has been adopted as part of e4.  Widgets can be styled by widget class name, or 
	can be tagged with an ID or a CSS class name.  Many properties are supported such as 
	fonts, colors, and border widths. In addition, some custom pseudo selectors such as 
	"CTabFolder:selected" can be used.  Most of the SWT widgets, as well as the Nebula Gallery 
	widget, can be thus styled.  The long term goal is that of modernizing the look of Eclipse 
	based applications.  
	<p>There are <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/E4/UI/Running_CSS_demos">several examples</a> 
	showing the capabilities of CSS-based styling. To get a feel for what can be done,
	there is a handy live editor with a set of 
	SWT controls, and a stylesheet which can be edited. Changes in the stylesheet are 
	immediately reflected in the widgets in the editor.  Similarly, one can audition 
	styling of the Gallery widget in its example editor.
	</p> 
	<p><img src="images/css-swt-editor.png" alt="Picture showing the CSS SWT Editor example" title="CSS SWT Editor" /></p> 
	<p> 
	CSS support can be used separate from the rest of e4.  The RCP mail application 
	example demonstrates this, showing that one can style many aspects of an existing 3.5 based
	RCP application. The example has as its base the same one generated as a plug-in example in
	the Eclipse SDK, with CSS support added to change fonts, background colors, and tab colors.
	</p> 
	<p><img src="images/css-rcp-example.png" alt="Picture showing the CSS RCP example" title="CSS RCP Example" /></p> 
	<p> 
	Note that in order to see the correct styling in the editor/view tabs, you will need to take Eclipse 
	<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/S-3.5M5-200902021535/index.php">M5</a>, 
	not  M4 as suggested in the install links.  However, one should be aware 
	that the (unrelated) XWT component needs M4 in order to install and run 
	correctly, so you may need two installs to try everything in e4.</p></td>

    <td width="70%" valign="top"> 
    Client-supplied implementations for UI components
    such as views and editors no longer have to extend framework classes, or
    implement framework interfaces. This has two advantages:
    <ul> 
    <li>It makes UI components reusable in different contexts,
    for example in sub-panes of editors, or in dialogs or wizards.</li> 
    <li>It enables implementations in other languages. Presently, JavaScript
    is supported.</li> 
 
    </ul> 
    <p>Rather than depending on "hub" interfaces like IWorkbench, UI components express
    dependencies on individual services. Examples of services are error logging, preference
    store, and styling engine. This set can be extended by application developers.</p> 
    <p>Dependency injection is used to supply these services, along with other
    required objects, to the constructor of the client object. For example, in the snippet
    below, the parent composite and the styling engine are both thus supplied.</p>

      Groups can only contain other groups or linked resources as children.
      <p>Groups are fully compatible with the existing 3.x Core Resource API, and all 
      plugins work just as expected.  Groups are seen internally by clients as a linked 
      resource folder with a null location (<tt>IResource.getLocation()</tt> returns <tt>null</tt>).

      <p>Resource filters are a powerful feature that allows an Eclipse 
      project to include folders that contains thousands of elements, but only include a 
      fraction of them in the project.  As opposed to UI view filters, resource filters are 
      applied at the lowest level, and do not incur any performance cost for excluded files and folders.

    the first pass at a development environment was implemented. The end goal of this

	<li>Launch support</li> 
	<li>Code completion for the subset of the Java class libraries used by SWT/BE</li> 
	<li>Error reporting</li> 
	</ul> 
	<p>Here is the debug view. You can set breakpoints and step in Java code that is 
	cross-compiled to ActionScript. When you step through the Java code, you are actually 
	stepping within the Flash player. You can click on stack frames and inspect variables.
	<p><img src="images/debug.png" alt="Debugger"></p> 
	<p>Just like on the desktop, you can concentrate on writing your Java code and let 
	the project builder automatically build and keep your project's ActionScript code incrementally up to date. 
	<p><img src="images/runas.png" alt="Run"></p> 
	</p> 
	<p>You can configure, run and debug your application using the integrated launch support. 
	The launch support allows for both static and dynamic linking of ActionScript code in 
	the generated SWF files. SWFs are automatically deployed to a local Jetty server, 
	provided by the launch support.
	<p><img src="images/launcher.png" alt="Launcher"></p> 
	</p> 
 
	<p>When you type, code completion is provided against the subset of the Java
	class libraries that ship with SWT/BE. This means that you will not reference classes 
	or methods that do not exist in the subset.
	<p><img src="images/codecompletion.png" alt="Code completion"></p>

	<p>For debugging purposes, you can monitor build progress in the ActionScript console.
