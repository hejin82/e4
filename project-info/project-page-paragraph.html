<p>e4 is the incubator for Eclipse 4.0, to be released 2010. Extending
on current Eclipse and OSGi technology, its major goals include</p>
<ul>
  <li>Making it easier to write plugins</li>
  <li>Allowing better control over the look of Eclipse based products</li>
  <li>Providing a uniform, pervasive platform across computing environments
  (Web / RIA, Desktop, Server, Cloud, Embedded)</li>
  <li>Increasing diversity of contributors to the platform</li> 
  <li>Maintaining backward compatibility for API-clean clients</li> 
</ul>
<p>In order to reach these goals, Eclipse APIs are is refactored into 
  <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/e4/Eclipse_Application_Services">services</a>
  that make up a uniform application model, which supports dependency 
  injection to run in multiple different contexts such as desktop or 
  web; the Workbench is uniformly 
  <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/e4/Workbench_Model">modeled</a>
  to provide introspection, more flexibility, CSS styling, and
  declarative UI markup; SWT target platforms are added to run
  in the Browser; and many more
  <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/e4">initiatives</a> in areas
  such as flexible resources, commands recording, scripting, 
  language integrations, reducing bloat, and more involving
  broad community participation.
</p>
<p>
The mission of the e4 project is to build a next generation platform for 
pervasive, component-based applications and tools. See the 
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/e4/">original project proposal</a>
for more details.
